# LoRa-Dashboard

Use LoRa compatible Esp32's to send sensor data through AWS IoT core to a React Front-end. Utalize REST, WebSockets and AWS IoT Core to allow remote sensing devices to send data to a React Web App.

## Development Environment Setup (`setup.sh`)

This script bootstraps the entire LoRa Dashboard project for developmentâ€”including backend, frontend, and ESP32 firmware.

### Features
- On first start creates .env for aws setup and secrets.cmake for ESP32 WiFi credentials.
- Optionally builds, flashes, and monitors ESP32 firmware (requires ESP-IDF toolchain).
- Checks for and installs dependencies for backend (Python virtual env) and starts services (MQTT, DynamoDB, backend API, frontend) using Docker Compose.
- Supports fake device data simulation.

### Requirements
- Docker
- Python 3 + venv
- npm (for frontend)
- AWS CLI
- ESP-IDF (for ESP32 operations, optional)
- mosquitto-clients (for MQTT subscribe utility)

Make sure docker, python3, npm, aws, and (optionally) ESP-IDF toolchains are installed and available in your PATH.

### Usage
```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh [OPTIONS]
```
Common options:
- `--backend-only`         Start only backend-related services
- `--frontend-only`        Start only frontend
- `--esp-only`             Run only ESP32 firmware operations (add with --build, --flash, --monitor)
- `--build`                Build ESP32 firmware
- `--flash`                Flash firmware to ESP32
- `--monitor`              Open ESP32 serial monitor
- `--port <dev>`           Specify serial port for ESP32
- `--fake-devices <n>`     Launch N fake devices for test data

Example: Build, flash, and monitor ESP32 only:
```sh
./setup.sh --esp-only --build --flash --monitor
```

Example: Start full stack with 5 fake devices:
```sh
./setup.sh --fake-devices 5
```

On first run, you will be prompted to enter WiFi credentials (for firmware) and AWS/DynamoDB info (for backend).
